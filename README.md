Hello, this is a red riding hood writing. The world hasn't been the same since the wolf's been gone. Don't get me wrong, I like it this way. I can skip through the woods, veer off the path and not worry I won't make it on time to grandma's. The only thing that's changed is that I am wiser by a sliver and stop to check my six occasionally. A red riding hood, and not the Red Riding Hood because I've also discovered other skipping, flower-picking girls on their way to grandma's. Those that made it out of the wolf's tummy, that is.
